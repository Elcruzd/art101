		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file
		structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang
		of it, but I had some difficulty showing the images and
		making them work right.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
